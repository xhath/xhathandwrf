WRF Post-Processing in R [newbie]

This is my script for processing WRF output file in R programming language, as we know the WRF output default setting is to create nc file with 60 minute interval, I create this script for my final undergraduate project to ease visualizing monthly WRF Output file

This script need 3 variable which is the directory for the output file, the variable you want to extract (in string), and month to extract (in string)
